/**
 Question:
 Similar to Question [62. Unique Paths], but now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. For example,
 There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3Ã—3 grid as illustrated below.
 [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
 ]
 The total number of unique paths is 2.
 
 Note: m and n will be at most 100.

 Extend from the Bottom-up DP approach in Q43. Just set the total paths to 0 when you encounter an obstacle.
