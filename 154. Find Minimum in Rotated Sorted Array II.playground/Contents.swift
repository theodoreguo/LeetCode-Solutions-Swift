/**
 Question:
 Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
 What if duplicates are allowed?
 Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 
 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 Find the minimum element.
 The array may contain duplicates.

/**
 For case where Al == Am == Ar, the minimum could be on Amâ€™s left or right side (eg, [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). In this case, we could not discard either subarrays and therefore such worst case degenerates to the order of O(n).
