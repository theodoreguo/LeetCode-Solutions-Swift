/**
 Question:
 Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum.
 For example, given the array [2, 1, –3, 4, –1, 2, 1, –5, 4], the contiguous array [4, –1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.

/**
 Dynamic programming:
 To devise a dynamic programming formula, let us assume that we are calculating the maximum sum of subarray that ends at a specific index.
 Let's denote that:
 f(k) = Maximum sum of subarray ending at index k.
 Then, f(k) = max(f(k-1) + nums[k], nums[k]).
 Using an array of size n, we could deduce the final answer by as f(n – 1), with the initial state of f(0) = A[0]. Since we only need to access its previous element at each step, two variables are sufficient.
 Notice the difference between the two: maxEndingHere and maxSoFar; the former is the maximum sum of subarray that must end at index k, while the latter is the global maximum subarray sum.

            maxSoFar = max(maxEndingHere, maxSoFar)
